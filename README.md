# SimpleMovieDatabaseCSharp
## Overview
A simple movie database website that allows users to:
- Register / Log In / Log Out
- Browse paginated views of movie entries.
- Perform protected CRUD operations over movie entries securely.

This codebase has the following characteristics:
- A modular and layered backend web application.
- Developed entirely from scratch, using only System.Net and no other frameworks (no ASP.NET).
- Made for teaching purposes.
- It implements the following architectures:
  - RESTful Endpoints Gateway (API)
  - Server-Side rendered (SSR)
  - Client-Side Rendered (CSR)
  - Single Page Application (SPA)
 
## Future Work
I plan to create several repos that do the same but using other programming languages and frameworks:
- Plain Old Vanilla .Net Core (C#)
- Plain Old Vanilla Net.Http (Java)
- Plain Old Vanilla Node.JS (JavaScript)
- ASP.Net (C#)
- Spring Boot (Java)
- Express (JavaScript)
- Django (Python)
